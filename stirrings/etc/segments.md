intro, [A] - [S]

[A]

    single short densely spaced urtext declamation;
    quiet normale color;
    colored pause;

    3-player elliptical process begins;
    colored pause continues underneath;

    3-player elliptical process increases;
    colored pause continues underneath;
    colored pause begins crescendo;

    3-player elliptical process increases even more;
    colored pause crescendos tremendously;

    3-player elliptical process sustains maximum intensity;
    colored pause sustains maximum intensity (possibly scratch);

    (shorter duration)
    3-player elliptical process subito lh-damp, subito slower speeds;
    colored pause subito tacet;
    pause;

    (another shorter duration)
    3-player lh-damp elliptical statement repeats;
    pause (ibid);

    (another shorter duration)
    3-player lh-damp elliptical statement repeats;

    (another shorter duration)
    3-player lh-damp elliptical statement repeats;
    much longer pause;

[B]

    (for a while)
    tutti lh-damp persists;
    completely regular clocktick 1/2 clt alt. full bowstrokes;
    no pause;

    (somewhat shorter)
    subito slightly slower (=broader + less flange);
    tutti lh-damp persists;
    completely regular clocktick 1/2 clt alt. full bowstrokes;
    no pause;

    (somewhat longer)
    subito faster than first appearance of color (at beginning of [B])
    tutti lh-damp persists;
    completely regular clocktick 1/2 clt alt. full bowstrokes;
    subito return of ellipses from end of [A];
    [[subito under-appearance of the future]]
    
    [[under-appearance of the future persists unaccompanied]]

    (shorter duration)
    [[under-appearance of the future subito tacet]]
    subito return of penultimate materials (without future):
    tutti lh-damp;
    lh-damp completely regular clocktick 1/2 clt alt. full bowstrokes;
    lh-damp ellipses;
    counted rest equal to exactly 1 1/2 clockticks (to displace next);

    lh-damp ellipses;
    counted rest equal to exactly 1 1/2 clockticks (to displace next);

    (another shorter duration)
    lh-damp completely regular clocktick 1/2 clt alt. full bowstrokes;
    lh-damp ellipses;
    counted rest equal to exactly 1 1/2 clockticks (to displace next);

    (much longer)
    [full trajectories appear for first time];
    tutti lh-damp 1/2 clt trajectories: capcious expansion;
    no pause;

    [pitch reppears after absence];
    va ppp tasto 1/2 clt trajectories;
    v1, v2, vc lh-damp 1/2 clt trajectories;
    no pause;

    v2, va tasto 1/2 clt trajectories;
    v1, vc lh-damp 1/2 clt trajectories; 
    no pause;

    v1, v2, va tasto 1/2 clt trajectories;
    vc lh-damp 1/2 clt trajectoreies;
    no pause;

    tutti tasto 1/2 clt trajectories;

    (longer)
    tutti 1/2 clt trajectories;
    very slow jagged interpolation from tasto to poco ponticello;
    surprisingly short pause;

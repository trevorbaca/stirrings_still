ARRIVAL
=======

the all-aboard pressures at the end of the process are the concerns, wishes,
very best hopes of others; they are others at a remove — because not yet here,
because already gone — and they are others who know with clarity why it is that
one pwish, one hope be be sent across.

it is a making-sure that none is left behind. points of view which each see
forever in all its parts — beautiful, ferocious, transcendent - and each find a
way, somehow, to back-advocate whatever aspects of the eternal they perceive in
a frame of the felt moments of we believe we experience here and now.

another voice, another wish can always join, and this is the reason for the
all-aboard. only a countable number of footholds to which the wishes, hopes
attach, each from the beyond and each pointing back squarely to it, the source
from which comes the percept of harmony and the fitting-the-joint. and which is
why any musical effort on its own will never be a coherent depiction of the
beyond: each moment, each stop, each start arises from beyond and points back
to it.

messages-back / messages-forward functions also to and from others, which is
why music provides the foothold: music's shapes are somehow selectable from an
otherwise unbridgeable remove; the shapes' understanding transmits. and every
i-was-only-the-vessel arises because in these moments there is only vessel and
the vessel holds only the footholds of transmission deidentified ahead of time
and able to function as both the target and the medium of transmission for that
reason.

ARRIVAL
=======

the all-aboard are the concerns, the wishes, the very best hopes of others. others at a
remove -- because not yet here, because already gone -- who know why a certain wish, a
certain hope transmits.

an all-aboard that is a making-sure none is left behind, that each find a foothold from
which to back-advocate an eternal -- beautiful, ferocious, transcendent -- hidden
everywhere in the frame of felt moments we believe we experience as a here and now. each
each stop, each start arising from the beyond and pointing back to it.

messages-back / messages-forward function to and from others. music's shapes somehow
select from an otherwise unbridgeable remove; the shapes' understanding transmits. every
i-was-only-the-vessel comes because the shapes arise deidentified, able to function as
both the target and the medium of transmission.

    vision of grid appears without explanation;

[C]

    white ellipses reppear and spiral out;
    interrupted by sotto voce retrospection:

        inflects scp;
        whitens;
        holds;
        pause;
    white tremolo begins again:
        inflects scp;
        loses pedal;
        slows;
        regains pedal;
        fades out;
    pedal persists incredibly;

[F]

    clouded pane blossoms fully:
        viola tailpiece begins under cover of clouded pane;
    clouded pane fades out:
        viola tailpiece persists;
        stops abruptly;
    long pause;

[G]

    lour√©-inflected clouded pane / urtext conflict appears:
        happens again four more times;
    long pause;
    saturated urtext field blossoms aflight;
    long pause;

[H]

    (nonflighted) urtext field appears from rasp:
        holds;
        surprisingly short breath [v2 holds over breath];
    desynchronized urtext field / ellipses appear gradually:
        increase in rate;
        rise slightly;
        fade out (as fast ellipses);
    underneath: urtext field transitions to clouded pane (harmonic):
        intensifies tremendously;
        persists;
        fades to ppp;
    above: polyrhythmic desynchronized whisk gears appear:
        reappear and darken three more times;
        persist as scratch gears;
        lighten from scratch to golden tone;

[I]

    golden gears continue:
        destabilize;
        accelerate;
        fade out;
    while during:
        1/2 clt vc solo trajectory cell begins;
        catches in quasivortex;
        grows louder;
        holds in repetition;
        fades out;
    [appena udibile urtext field appears from underneath];

[J]

    appena udibile urtext field continues;
        intensifies;
    3x repetition vortex:
        fff urtext field holds;
        composite 1/2 clt trajectories / ellipses:
            appear;
            accelerate;
            fade;
            
[K] 
    
    pp 1/2 clt trajectories continue:
        crescendo to mp;
        become flight;
        surprisingly short breath;
    flight:
        shimmers;
        becomes clouded pane field;
        fades out to tasto possibile;
        reveals quiet clouded pane fundamental;
        surprisingly short breath;

[L]

    clouded pane oscillates ff blossom of full multiphonic extremely slowly:
        animated by intermittent 1/2 clt trajectories;

[M]

    full expression of clouded pane continues:
        animated by interrmitent conflicting urtext ellipses;
    falls a single step;

[N]

    full expression of clouded pane continues:
        fades;
    while during: urtext field fades in:
        intensifies to f;
        takes flight;
        intensifies to ff;
        expires!;
    very long pause;
    composite clouded pane / urtext field appears and expires;
    very long pause;

[O]

    granulated urtext field / ellipses appear:
        hold;
        stop;
    very long pause;

[P]

    ppppp clouded pane appears:
        admixed with intermittent ellipses;
        becomes ellipses;
    ellipses accelerate;
        rise;
    surprisingly short breath;

[Q]

    compression process:
        spinning white noise;
        alternating with: pitch field trajectories whisked skyward;
        all under structural decrescendo;
    piece-final memory of flight appears;

[R]

    memory of flight persists;
    while during: trajectories disappear;

[S]

    memory of flight persists:
        animated by intermittent golden ellipses:
            intensify;
            expire;
    memory of flight expires.

1.  at what non-piece-initial moments do rest-offset single-material exposures
    become charged?

2.  where does jeux des terminaisons recur after [D]?

3.  where does delamation recur after [G]?

DRAMATURGY
==========

[A]

    urtext appears;
        ellipses shine through;
    ellipses persist;

[B]

    clockticks begin;
        ellipses reappear;
    clockticks (and ellipses) become trajectories;
        [[TODO: extend B.12 with recollection of urtext]]
    trajectories intensify;
    trajectories become ellipses and expire;
    vision of grid appears without explanation;

[C]

    white ellipses reppear and spiral out;
    interrupted by sotto voce retrospection:
        * composite urtext clockticks (as vision-of-before);
    white ellipses resume, synchronize, effect transitions:
        * damped-to-harmonic
        * harmonic-to-half-harmonic-to-stopped
    colored ellipses fade out over down-glissandi;

[D]

    white tutti termination grid appears, synchronizes;
        pause;
    single urtext declamation reappears;
        long pause;
    clouded pane appears (without explanation) for first time in piece;
        long pause;
    single urtext declamation repeats;
        long pause;
    white tutti termination grid reappears and fades out;
        long pause;
    colored composite urtext field / clouded pane / flight:
        begins;
        intensifies;
        persists;
        fades out;
        pedal persists;
        short pause;

[E]

    subtended tremolo returns subito white;
        short pause;
    white desynchronized grid begins:
        holds;
        colors (1/2 clt);
        syncrhonizes;
        ascends slightly from under ferocity;
        persists;
        ascends slightly (again);
        expires;
    subtended 1/2 clt cells appear:
        hold;
        fade into tremolo;
        color (hair);
        tremolo holds;
        short pause;
    colored tremolo reappears:
        inflects scp;
        expires;
        pause;
    colored tremolo appears again:
        inflects scp;
        whitens;
        holds;
        pause;
    white tremolo begins again:
        inflects scp;
        loses pedal;
        slows;
        regains pedal;
        fades out;
    pedal persists incredibly;

[F]

    clouded pane blossoms fully:
        viola tailpiece begins under cover of clouded pane;
    clouded pane fades out:
        viola tailpiece persists;
        stops abruptly;
    long pause;

[G]

    lour√©-inflected clouded pane / urtext conflict appears:
        happens again four more times;
    long pause;
    saturated urtext field blossoms aflight;
    long pause;

[H]

    (nonflighted) urtext field appears from rasp:
        holds;
        surprisingly short breath [v2 holds over breath];
    desynchronized urtext field / ellipses appear gradually:
        increase in rate;
        rise slightly;
        fade out (as fast ellipses);
    underneath: urtext field transitions to clouded pane (harmonic):
        intensifies tremendously;
        persists;
        fades to ppp;
    above: polyrhythmic desynchronized whisk gears appear:
        reappear and darken three times;
        persist as scratch gears;
        lighten from scratch to golden tone;

################################## QUESTIONS ##################################
###############################################################################

1.  at what non-piece-initial moments do rest-offset single-material exposures
    become charged?

2.  where does jeux des terminaisons recur after [D]?

3.  where does delamation recur after [G]?

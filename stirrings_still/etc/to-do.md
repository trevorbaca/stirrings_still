IV:
    M[7+13+6]:      a little strident; klaxonlike; not enough low (x)
                    use to hold stress;

    M[6+11+5]:      a little bittersweet (5-6 just minor third) (ok)
                    pronounced interval gives 'songlike' endurance;
                    use only in medias res;
                    use to hold stress;
                    not resting sonority.

    M[5+9+4]:       mod. major triad (4-5 major third) + hint of 9th (ok)
    M[5+9+13+4]:    ibid. with hint of 'divine' 13th (+)
                    use as inflected major-triad tonic home;
                    use with +13 where practicable
                    resting sonority.

    M[4+11+7+3]:    cadential triad (3-4 perfect fourth) (x)
                    overly pronounced 7th;

    M[7+10+3]:      wavering 3-7 min third (!!);
                    simultaneously resting and activated;
                    scodanibbio favorite.

    M[7+10+13+3]:   ibid. but encourages wolftone (x)

    M[3+11+8]:      colored simultaneous tonic / dominant (!)
                    sustainable resting sonority;
                    use in lead-up to fully activated resting sonority;
                    "precursor" resting sonority.

    M[3+8+13+5]:    major triad with 13th instability (x);
                    too similar to major triad.

    M[5+12+7]:      strong 3, strong 7 (x);
                    overly pronounced 7th.
